# SMSEncryption
This is an SMS Encryption client for andriod which utilizes 2048 bit RSA asymmetric encryption.
Thanks to Android Studio I was forced to upload files manually... so, sorry about that. 
The manifest and the three main .java classes are all that's really needed.
Also, this was thrown together very hastily during a short hackathon, so excuse bad formatting or spaghetti-code.
